Version 2020a (in development)
----------------------------------------------------

- **Improvement**

  #. A ponding water scheme is added in the automatic irrigation calculation;
  useful when a certain depth of ponding water to maintain in irrigation
  (e.g., flooding irrigation in rice crop-field).



- **Changes**

  #. A new `RoughLenHeatMethod` option `5`:
  adaptively choose option `1` for fully pervious surface
  or `2` otherwise (if any impervious surface exists).

  #. A new column `H_maintain` is added in ``SUEWS_Irrigation.txt``
  to set ponding water depth.

- **Fix**

  #. Irrigation over impervious surfaces is allowed;
  currently assuming irrigaton fration.


- **Known issues**

  #. Wind direction is not currently downscaled
  so non -999 values will cause an error.
