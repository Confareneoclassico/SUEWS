Version 2019a (planned release in late September 2019)
----------------------------------------------------

- **Improvement**

  #. An anthropogenic emission module is added. Module details refer to JÃ¤rvi et al. (2019) [J19]_.

  #. A `canyon profile module <Wind, Temperature and Humidity Profiles in the Roughness Sublayer>`_ is added. Module details refer to Theeuwes et al. (2019) [T19]_.



- **Changes**

  #. Input file ``SUEWS_AnthropogenicHeat.txt`` is renamed to ``SUEWS_AnthropogenicEmission.txt`` with new parameters added: `MinFCMetab`, `MaxFCMetab`, `FrPDDwe`, `FcEF_v_kgkmWD` and `FcEF_v_kgkmWE`.
  #. BLUEWS has been recovered; set `CBLUse` to use it.
  #. Removed features:
    - SOLWEIG: fully removed from code.
    - netCDF: fully removed as this is very infrequently used;
      users who need this are suggested to use `SuPy`
      with help from `pandas` and `xarray` to save results in netCDF more elegantly.


- **Fix**

  #. Fixed a bug in LAI calculation for longterm runs.
  #. Fixed a bug in net all-wave radiation differential calculation for OHM.
  #. Fixed a bug in GDD/SDD calculation that different vegetative land covers could unexpectedly affect each other.
  #. Fixed water redistribution bug in snow module.

- **Known issues**

  #. Observed soil moisture can not be used as an input
  #. Wind direction is not currently downscaled so non -999 values will cause an error.
